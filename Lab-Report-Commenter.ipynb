A piece of aluminum foil was folded and placed to cover the cups. A piece of cardboard was then placed on top of the aluminum foil. Two holes were made --one for the thermometer, one for the stirrer. After making the calorimeter, for each trial, a total of 80 mL of deionized water was used, measured using a graduated cylinder. 40 mL of the room temperature water was placed into the calorimeter, and the remaining 40 mL was heated to a desirable temperature using a Bunsen burner. The temperature of both waters were taken prior to combining them in the calorimeter. After recording the temperatures, the heated water was poured into the calorimeter, stirred and monitored the temperature, the most stable temperature was recorded. The temperature change as well as the specific heat of water was used to find the heat capacity of water. These exact steps were performed for three trials using the Styrofoam calorimeter, and three trials using the commercial calorimeter to ensure that the data was consistent.\"\n",
